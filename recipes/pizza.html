    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed</li>
        <li>16 sticks string cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, and onion
            powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer
            running, add remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and
            forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl. Cover with a clean towel
            and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion onto a prepared pan. Cover and
            let rest for about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let
            rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough
            to seal. Repeat with the second pan.
        </li>
    </ol>
